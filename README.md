ðŸ‘‹  Hi, my name is Chris Romkema, I am a senior software engineer and I work contract based for many companies in the Netherlands. My primairy focus on Java work/assignments.

My nickname is Blade_Reaver or in cases that the underscore is not allowed (like GitHub): BladeReaver

<!-- Old profile:
I currently work as a Java developer for a big company that has contract based work. I have worked for them at several companies spread throughout different fields. The last few jobs have been at large banks in the Netherlands. In my spare time, I mostly game and spend some time updating my knowledge.
